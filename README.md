# Web App Template with Django and Docker-Compose

This project makes it quick and simple to develop a docker-composed Django application
locally and deploy to a remote server for production use. The default application is a
web-based request and response platform.

## Getting Started

To begin development on this project, add your environment variables by running
`./env.sh dev` and filling in the variable values by following the instructions. 
Then simply run `./deploy.sh dev` to spin up a collection of docker files. 
`./deploy.sh -h` displays the help file for the deployment script, `./deploy.sh -c` 
cleans up the build files (don't use this unless you don't like using the 
`docker-compose down` command...).

### Prerequisites

You'll need a working Docker and Docker Compose installation to use this project, as
well as an installation of Python3.6+.

### Remote Deployment

To deploy to a remote server, ensure that the server HOSTNAME, traefik.HOSTNAME, and
db.HOSTNAME all have A records that point to the server's IP and that you've filled in 
the prod environment variables (use `./env.sh prod`).

Copy the application folder to the remote server using `scp -r $PWD user@hostname:dest_folder` 
from inside the project directory (or `git clone` if that's your speed). Log into the 
remote server via SSH, navigate to the destination folder, and run `./deploy.sh prod -b`. 
Give it 30 seconds or so to establish container health, and you're off to the races.

## Sample Application

Deployed as-is, the application produces a web-based request and response platform. You 
can learn more about using that application [HERE](app/questgiver/README.md)
